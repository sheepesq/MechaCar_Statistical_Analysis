## Linear Regression to Predict MPG ##

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? ###
- The variables that provided the most amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are ground clearance and vehicle length 

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? ###
- The slope of the linear model is not zero as the p-value does not support that.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? ###
-This linear model had a result of Multiple R-squared:  0.7149 meaning that it will be correct 71% of the time.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils ##

### Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not? ###
-Lot 1 and 2 have a mean of 1500, while lot 3 has a mean of 1496.14, which means it does not mean the design specifications of 1500psi.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils ##
###  summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results ###
- Lot 1 and 2 have 95% of their fall with in an acceptable range of variance regarding the PSI. Lot 2 has slightly more varianc. Lot 3 has a majority of its produciton fall under the 1500 PSI.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition ##
### What metric or metrics are you going to test? ###
- A popular metric to test MechCar vs the Competition's Cars is MPG. This is an important factor for customers when car shopping.

### What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis? ###
- The Null hypothesis for the breakdown of data is that all of the produced cars are of the same quality and are running at the same level of performance.

### What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why? ##
- you could test multiple cars of the same make/model to get an average on how the car actually performes, and use that average over just one sample.

### What data is needed to run the statistical test? ###
- you would need multiples of the same car in order to run this test
